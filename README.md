# BookingAirplaneTicketsApp
WebAPI-Angular application

Coding Assignment 

HIGH-LEVEL GOAL 
The high-level goal of the coding assignment is to implement a web-based application to book airplane tickets for two different airline companies (Airline A and Airline B). The tool has to enable listing, adding, editing, and deleting airplane tickets. The companies have a different format for tickets. They differ in the required and optional data explained below. 

TASK 1: WEB API 
Create a .NET Core based RESTful API that will enable basic CRUD operations on airline tickets. date The RESTful API should be implemented with the latest software engineering practices and design patterns. 

TASK 2: FRONTEND APPLICATION 
Create a frontend application that will consume the RESTful API defined in TASK 2. The frontend application should follow the latest software engineering practices and design patterns. The frontend application can be built with any frontend JavaScript/TypeScript MV(VM) framework. For the UI elements, any UI framework can be used (Bootstrap, Material, etc…), and a ready-made template is acceptable. The application has to provide a user interface for the following use cases: list airline tickets from different airline companies, adding, editing, and deleting airplane tickets. Here are the mockups for creating (and editing) tickets from the Airline A and Airline B. 

ADDITIONAL NOTES 

Interaction with the team members is encouraged to discuss the design of your solution. The point of this assignment is, apart from assessing coding skills, to give us a better idea of how you would solve tasks within a team. So don’t hesitate to ask questions if something is unclear, and if you believe that several different approaches to solving the problem are possible, you are encouraged to reach out to discuss your proposed approach before implementing it. 
There is no set deadline for completing the assignment, but delivering a solution sooner is considered as a plus. That said, we prefer a correct and clean answer over a quick and dirty one, and if other deadlines would conflict with this work, please discuss an expected timeline with us. After submission, we will review and discuss your solution with suggestions for improvements, akin to what our normal pull request review process looks like. 

Please make sure that the submitted assignment: 
• compiles and runs from Visual Studio; 
• uses InMemory DB if no proper DB connection string is provided 
• handles any invalid input appropriately; and 
• is submitted as a link to a git repository containing your solution (please remove after the interview process concludes) 

Optional functionality: 
• unit testing 
• integration testing 
• API documentation 

The assignment will be evaluated based on the following: 
• Correctness 
• Cleanliness (is the code easy to understand? Here, less really is more) 
• Robustness (does the code work in all cases, or does it fail for some?) 
• Interaction with team members
